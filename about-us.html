            Hey there! Remember those days in polytechnic when you'd eagerly queue up for the 3D printer, only to end up with subpar prints and wasted time? Yeah, been there, done that. It was beyond frustrating, having to stick around just to keep an eye on the machine, hoping your project wouldn't be the next victim of poor quality.
         </p>
         <p class="new__description"> 
            That's why we started WE ARE GRIND*R, to help out other students facing the same struggles we did. As former students ourselves, we understand the frustration of unreliable 3D printing services.
